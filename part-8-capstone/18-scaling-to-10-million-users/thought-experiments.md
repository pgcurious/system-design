# Thought Experiments: Scaling to 10 Million Users

## Status: Coming Soon

These thought experiments will explore:

1. **The Premature Optimization Trap**: You have 1,000 users but want to design for 10 million from day one. What are the costs of over-engineering early?

2. **The Database Decision**: You're at 100,000 users and PostgreSQL is struggling. Do you shard, move to NoSQL, or add read replicas? How do you decide?

3. **The Microservices Moment**: Your monolith is becoming unwieldy. Which services do you extract first, and how do you manage the transition?

4. **The Global Expansion**: You're US-only at 1 million users. Europe users complain about latency. What's your multi-region strategy?

5. **The Cost Cliff**: At 5 million users, your cloud bill is 60% of revenue. What architectural changes could improve unit economics?
